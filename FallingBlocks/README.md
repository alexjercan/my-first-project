# Falling Blocks

This game is an endless runner where the main character muts avoid the spikes
at the top and also falling down. You must always stay on the pipes.

This project started off as a proof of concept of make random pipes on the
screen, hence the name, but it evolved in a game that I used to play on an old
Nokia phone.
